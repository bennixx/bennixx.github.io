title: Race condition in ptrace() allows setuid debugging
---
A race condition exists in `ptrace()` that allows any user to attach to setuid processes. The core issue is a lack of synchronisation between `ptrace()` and `execve()`.

## Details
When handling a `ptrace()` syscall the kernel starts by checking the state of the process, permissions, supplied arguments etc. If all these checks pass the kernel will continue to perform the requested action. This can be seen as two seperate steps.

The problem is that there is a small window between these steps. In this window 'things' could change without the kernel being aware of that. For example, the debuggee might be running with different privileges.

A sample timeline of how the bug might happen:
```
| Tracer             | Debuggee        |
----------------------------------------
|                    | running ...     |
| PT_ATTACH          |                 |
|  1. run checks     |                 |
|  2. perform action |                 |
|                    |                 |
| PT_CONTINUE        |                 |
|  1. run checks     |                 |
|  2. perform action |                 |
|                    |                 |
| PT_POKE            |                 |
|  1. run checks     |                 |
|  *interrupt*       |                 |
|                    | execl() setuid  |
|                    | setting m_euid  |
|                    | load elf        |
|  2. perform action |                 |
|  BUG HERE          |                 |
```
## Reproducing
The window to race is very small, and in this window a lot of other code must run. To reproduce the bug its easiest to widen the window with a fake sleep at the critical moment.

```
     case PT_POKE:
+        // Fake a delay to increase the race window
+        for(int i=0; i<4096; i++) {
+            klog() << "PT_POKE: delaying..." << i;
+        }
+        klog() << "PT_POKE: all security checks done, going to poke!";
```
Before showing the bug you can use the attached demo script to show NORMAL behaviour, even when this patch is applied. The script will:

- `fork()` 
- parent: attach to child
- child: run a setuid binary
- parent: call `PT_POKE`. this fails because of permissions
Expected output:

```
$ demo
parent: running with pid xx
parent: attached, calling PT_CONTINUE
child: running with pid xx
child: calling setuid binary
New password:
parent: calling PT_POKE. This should fail.
PT_POKE: Permission denied
```
Now comment out the sleep in the parent:

```
	// sleep a bit and let the child execute execl
	// sleep(3);
```
This will mimic the timeline above. The code now calls `PT_POKE` before the child has started the setuid binary. All checks pass, but because of the added print statements it will hang for a bit after the checks. By the time printing is done the debuggee has changed to the setuid `passwd`, but we are still allowed to poke it.

Expected output:

```
$ demo_no_sleep
parent: running with pid xx
parent: attached, calling PT_CONTINUE
child: running with pid xx
child: calling setuid binary
New password:
parent: calling PT_POKE. This should fail.
PT_POKE: Bad address                        <-- BUG: should be permission denied
```
## Exploitation
Exploitation might be tricky:

- the racing window is very small
- can only do one ptrace() call on debuggee
- dont know anything about memory layout of debuggee
